# Morse-Code-Interpreter
This project implements a Morse Code interpreter using an Arduino and an LCD display. It captures button presses to detect Morse code input (dots and dashes), decodes it via a binary tree, and displays the corresponding letters on the LCD. The project includes debouncing logic to ensure accurate input from the button.
